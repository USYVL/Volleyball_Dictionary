###Vollyball_Dictionary

This is a little nodejs app that Aja created for fun and practice.  It was never really deployed anywhere.

It provides a sort of glossary of volleyball terms that USYVL players and parents might here at games/practices and be unfamiliar with. 

---
This application allows the client app to get, post and delete terms from the server application through an api. This application uses HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript and NodeJS.

###Installation:
This application requires the installation of NodeJS. The program can then be run with the following npm commands. 'npm' is the package manager that comes with NodeJS.

###Instructions
```shell
npm install 
npm start
```
After running the above commands on the command line you should see that "Vballdictionary app running on port 3000". Once you see this message you can enter "http://localhost:3000" in your browser to run the app.
